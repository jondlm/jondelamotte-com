    <h1>Nearing Real-time</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is, unfortunately, one of the chief characteristics of modern business to be always in a hurry.&quot; </p>
<p><em>The Medical Record</em> - 1884 from <a href="http://xkcd.com/1227/">XKCD</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some things never change. But, it&#39;s safe to say that since 1884 the pace of business has quantifiably increased; we would know, cause we measure everything. Advances in personal technology, such as social media, have particularly raised the definition of &quot;fast&quot; when it comes to delivering data. As technologists, we are tasked with staying up-to-date on emerging technologies. As I&#39;ve found, this can be a daunting task. Let&#39;s skim the surface on one of the most recent web technologies that&#39;s changing the way you get data to your web browser. It&#39;s an invisible hero slaving away in your browser and on the server.</p>
<h2>Enter Websockets</h2>
<p>I hope I haven&#39;t scared any non-techies away. Let&#39;s attempt to explore this new technology without too much jargon. Websockets is a new web communication feature that changes the way web browsers can talk to servers. Simply put, websockets do two main things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make data move much faster</li>
<li>Allow the server to send messages to the client without the client explicitly asking for it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Traditional</h2>
<p>First let&#39;s examine what a typical web page request looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://jondelamotte.com/img/oldschool.gif" alt="A server and client connecting without websockets"></p>
<p>The key to remember in this scenario is that the server does not have the ability to talk to the web browser unless the web browser asks for something. &quot;Do not speak unless spoken to,&quot; one might say.</p>
<h2>With Websockets</h2>
<p>Using websockets, the server breaks out of this mold and finds a faster, more open method of communication with the web browser that functions more like a &quot;phone call.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="http://jondelamotte.com/img/websockets.gif" alt="A server and a client connection with websockets"></p>
<p>As you can see, once this &quot;phone call&quot; is established, it allows the server to send messages to the web browser with being asked for anything; this is a big win when you need to push data to a client. Another good thing about websockets is that they mostly &quot;just work&quot; through firewalls.</p>
<h2>But WHY?</h2>
<p>Websockets will dramatically increase the speed and efficiency of browser based stuff like real-time dashboards, chat clients, multi-player games, and much more. Websockets are already implemented on &quot;all&quot; major browsers. Visit this <a href="http://html5demos.com/web-socket">demo</a> to see if your browser can connect using websockets. </p>
